# Rocket Propulsion Application
Plot the velocity of the rocket for the first 10 seconds for four values of f:

o 20,000, 40,000, 60,000, and 80,000 N.

o Include a title, axis labels, a grid, and a legend

The equation of motion of a rocket-propelled sled is from Newton's law,

m(dv/dt)=f-c

where m is the sled mass, f is the rocket thrust, and c is an air resistance coefficient. 

Suppose that m = 1000kg and c = 500N*s/m. Suppose also that v(0) = 0.

The velocity will be in m/s.
